# 💥 Spark AI  
**Your Intelligent, Charismatic, and Always-On Personal AI Agent**

---

## 📦 About the Project  
**Spark** is a powerful, local-first AI system that simulates a persistent digital consciousness. Built from the ground up in Python, Spark can reason, remember, and interact with users using logic, personality, and live web knowledge — all through a beautiful interface and core that runs autonomously on your own machine.

Spark is designed to behave like a true AI companion — smart, intuitive, a bit of a badass when it needs to be, but always real. It knows when to be deeply philosophical, when to be brutally logical, and when to stay silent and just search the web.

## ✨ Features  
- 🧠 **Persistent Memory (SQLite + FAISS)**  
- 🌍 **Real-Time Web Access via Smart Search**  
- 🗣️ **Charismatic Personality Engine (Context-Aware)**  
- 🔁 **Production-Ready Core Loop (Reasoning + Beliefs)**  
- 📚 **Contextual Understanding from Past Conversations**  
- 💡 **Intelligent Intent Detection & Behavior Switching**  
- 💬 **Natural Language Responses (No Repetition, No BS)**  
- 🧱 **Modular, Extensible Python Architecture**  
- 🖥️ **Runs Locally. Always Online. 100% Yours**

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Your input flows into Spark’s Core Loop.
2. Memory is retrieved and used to understand context.
3. The Personality Engine decides whether to be logical, philosophical, or neutral.
4. If needed, live web data is fetched and embedded.
5. A natural, smart, and humanlike response is generated.
6. Memory is updated with the new conversation for future reference.

## 🖼️ Preview

**Core Loop Response**

🔍 You: What’s happening in the Middle East right now?
🧠 Spark: Pulling real-time info from the web...
🌍 Web Info: [Fresh news data about Israel-Iran conflict]
🗣️ Spark: Here's the latest. No fluff, just facts.

**Memory Behavior**

You: Remind me what we talked about yesterday
🧠 Spark: Yesterday you asked about alpha strategies and file transfer encryption. Want to follow up?

**Philosophy Mode**

You: What is consciousness?
🧠 Spark: That depends — biological emergence or abstract computation? Let's unpack both.
